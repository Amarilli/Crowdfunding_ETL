# ETL group project

## Team

## Summary

Our group built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, Python dictionary methods, and regular expressions to extract and 

transform the data. 

Also, we created four CSV files and used them to create an ERD and a table schema. 

Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
